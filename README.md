# Seti Monokai Sublime for VS Code

This is a copy of the [Seti Monokai Theme](https://github.com/poucotm/Theme-SetiMonokai/blob/master/scheme/Seti%20Monokai.tmTheme) for use in VS Code.

It's nearly the same theme as [Theme - Seti-Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SmukkeKim.theme-setimonokai) only with subtle changes. If you don't mind the differences I suggest to use the official theme from the store in favor of this repository.

## Usage

Go to `~/.vscode/extensions` and clone the repository inside:

    git clone git@github.com:garthenweb/seti-monokai-sublime-for-vscode.git theme-setimonokai-sublime
